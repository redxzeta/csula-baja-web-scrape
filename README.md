# csula-baja-web-scrape

##  Purpose

I needed to grab some data from the school club's website and did not want to copy and paste. I figured it would be a good opportunity to use Python with `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`

## How to use

1. install `Poetry`

1. `poetry install`

1. `poetry shell`

1. set environment to csula club site

1. download the driver for the browser you plan to use with selenium

1. run `main.py`
